### Description:
This repository contains 3 folder each of which is seperate projects. These projects all are related with deep learning. Projects were taken from Kagle and also extra problems were solved in addition to Kagle. Deep learning is widely used machine learning section wich uses different kind of neural network algorithms. Each of these algorithms address different kind of problems such as time series problems, image processing, image generation, image and voice classification etc. Deep learning methods we use to solve these kind of problems are: dense network, convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long-short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), directed acyclic graph (DAG), neural style transfer, variational autoencoders. I have finished three projects addressing different problems:
1. Classification of the leaves;
2. Seatle weather prediction;
3. Classification of the voices of the cats and dogs.

In each project, the main objective is to find the optimum  deep learning algorithm and its architecture that will prevent overfitting and increase accuracy of the model. I also want the model to be computationally efficeint as well. Then I also investigated which features of the data plays more crucial role in classification of data.

### Programs:
- Python
- Excel
- LaTex

Keras library was used for different type of deep learning algorithms in python. In addition to this library, tensor flow, matplotlib, pandas, os, and other data preperation and visualization libraries were used.
