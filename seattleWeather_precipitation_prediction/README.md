##
## In this project different type of DNN (deep neural network) methods have been used to predict precipitation ammount:
## 1. First naive base case is created using mean absolute error.
## 2. Dense connected model is used
## 3. Gated reccurent unit (GRU)
## 4. GRU using regularizer and dropout layer
## 5. bi-directional Long/short term memory (bi-directional LSTM)
## 6. LSTM with reversed sequence
## 7. Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 1D dimension
## 8. Combining CNN and GRU with long sequences
## 9. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) network.
## Accuracies of each model is compared with each other and specially with base case
