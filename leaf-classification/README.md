### This project is classification of the leaves images using deep neural network methods. The main objectives of this project are:
##### 1. To investigate deep learning method that gives higher accuracy. Compare different deep learning methods.
#### 2. Visualize activations and filters of convolutional neural network.
#### Download the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification
 Divide the imagesinto three sets. Make sure that each data set is balancedâ€”roughly equal number of each class. Use the three sets as the training set.
#### Train your classifier using each of the following techniques:
#### a.Train a dense network directly on these data sets,
#### b.Train a deep network directly on these data sets,
#### c.Train a deep network directly on these data sets with data augmentation (minimize the use of excessive transformations),
#### d.Use fine tuning with dense network, and
#### e.Use fine tuning with dense network with the last convolutional block.
#### Visualize the activations due to any two classes of your choice. Write few sentences commenting on which part(s) of an input image is/are related to a specific class.
